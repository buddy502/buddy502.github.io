add a url box between black header and song box for youtube songs
NOTE:
    use viewport size if you need to make the placement change

make sure that the context menu stays inside the Media Library box
and it also doesn't go out of bounds

!Fix the arrow keys for volume and seekbar
!Make sure if random button is active, then skip will skip to the next random song

!Fix metadata so it doesn't use createObjectURL because it creates url

!If folder is added create a new container holding all of the songs once clicked
