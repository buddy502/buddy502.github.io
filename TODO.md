add a url box between black header and song box for youtube songs
NOTE:
    use viewport size if you need to make the placement change

make sure that the context menu stays inside the Media Library box
and it also doesn't go out of bounds

!Fix the arrow keys for volume and seekbar

!If folder is added create a new container holding all of the songs once clicked

!Create search bar. Use indexedDB for the stored information

!!Make sure that there's a currentNode to track the current position
of the song. Use that position to iterate backwards and forwards
into the dll.
